# Transportation in Carpetlands

Transportation in Carpetlands is unique, with every inhabitant owning a boat. There is no ferry or bridge connecting the island to the European mainland, making boats the primary means of travel. A boat ride to Denmark takes about 2 hours.

The island's residents are adept sailors, with boating skills passed down through generations. These skills are not just practical but form an integral part of Carpetlands' cultural heritage. The boats themselves are often family heirlooms, beautifully crafted and maintained with great care.

### Local Transportation

Within the island, transportation is largely by foot or bicycle, given the small size and close-knit layout of the community. Narrow, scenic paths crisscross the island, making every journey a pleasant experience. The absence of motor vehicles enhances the island's tranquility and helps preserve its pristine environment.

### Maritime Services

Carpetlands boasts a well-organized maritime service. Each household has a designated docking area, and there's a central marina where community boats are stored and serviced. The marina is a bustling hub of activity, especially during the early mornings and late afternoons when residents head out or return from their journeys.
