## Early Settlers

The first inhabitants of Carpetlands were seafaring tribes from the North Sea region, arriving around the 8th century. These early settlers were drawn to the island's fertile soil and abundant fishing waters. They established small fishing villages and developed early maritime trading routes, making Carpetlands a crucial stopover for merchants.

### Medieval Era

During the medieval era, Carpetlands flourished as a maritime trading center. Its strategic location between the Netherlands and Denmark made it an essential hub for trade and commerce. The island became known for its skilled shipbuilders and navigators, who were highly sought after by European traders.

In the 12th century, the island fell under the control of the Duchy of Holstein. This period saw the construction of several stone fortifications, remnants of which can still be seen today. The influence of Holstein brought new architectural styles and cultural practices to Carpetlands, enriching its local traditions.
